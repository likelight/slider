This is  my first github program;
The slider is used to be draggale and can be customied with a box wich you can fill in the value;
The slider consists of three parts:the slider ,which looks like a long square; a bar on the slider which can be moved;a box
can be customised which can show the value of the slider,and the value will be changed when the bar changes its position;
